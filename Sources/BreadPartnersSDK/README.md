## Agenda of Native SDK
The goal of this SDK is to develop a native CocoaPod library that provides "Buy Now, Pay Later" functionality to multiple
brands through our financial payment service. This library will enable these brands to integrate our services into their
native applications. The native applications will interact with our API to receive an HTML response, which will be rendered
in a text view. Part of the text view will include interactive buttons that, when clicked, open a popup view. The popup
view may either: Display additional HTML content with buttons, or Directly display a WebView within the popup. The WebView
will navigate to our CSP (Content Security Policy) website to facilitate "Buy Now, Pay Later" transactions. Any actions
performed within the WebView will be monitored, and the respective success or failure events will trigger callbacks that
are passed back to the brand's native application for further processing.

## Overview  
The Native Web View SDK is a CocoaPod library designed to integrate "Buy Now, Pay Later" functionality into brand-native
applications. This SDK simplifies the process of interacting with our financial payment services by rendering HTML content,
managing WebView interactions, and providing callbacks for seamless integration.

## Workflow

1. **API Call**:  
   - The brand-native app makes a request to the API and receives an HTML response.

2. **Text View Rendering**:  
   - HTML content is displayed in a text view, including buttons for triggering popup views.

3. **Popup Display**:  
   - The popup may render additional HTML or a WebView for transactions.

4. **WebView Navigation**:  
   - The embedded WebView directs users to our CSP-compliant website to complete their transactions.

5. **Callback Handling**:  
   - Actions performed in the WebView trigger success or failure callbacks, which are passed back to the brand-native app.
